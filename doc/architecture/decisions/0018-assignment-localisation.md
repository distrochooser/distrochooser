# 18. Assignment localization

Date: 2026-01-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The translation process is a high effort task. As a consequency, shortcuts must be taken where available.

## Decision

For assignments, if no assignment text is given, the translation of the first related facettes is taken.

## Consequences

Between assignments and linked facettes, a more strong bond is created. It results in the possbile need to change the relation between facettes and assignments in the future, as currently, a facette only is assigned to one assignment.
