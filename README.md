This Repository contains the source code of the Linux Distribution Chooser from
[distrochooser.de](http://distrochooser.de) for developing purposes.
Feel free to fork the program, for example, to offer a new language edition.
Please note that this repository contains only the code of the program including
a database dump with the questions. Third party things like the logos of the several distributions are not included.

The program uses [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/),
including [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).
