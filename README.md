This repository contains the sourcecode of the Linux Distro Chooser from
[distrochooser.de](http://distrochooser.de) for developing purposes.
Feel free to fork the program for example to offer a new language edition.
Please note: This repository only contains the code of the program including
a database dump containing the questions. Third party things,
for example Logos of the several distributions, are not included.

The program uses [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/),
including [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).
