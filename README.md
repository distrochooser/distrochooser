This Repository contains the sourcecode of the Linux Distro Chooser from distrochooser.0fury.de for developing purposes. Feel free to fork the program for example to offer a new language edition. Please note: This repository only contains the code of the program including a database dump containing the questions. Third party things, for example Logos of the several distributions, are not included.

The program uses jQuery (https://jquery.com/) and Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/), including FontAwesome (http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).
